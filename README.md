## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure_password_sharing.git
$ cd secure_password_sharing
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
- **Linux/MacOS**:
  ```bash
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  > venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following:
```env
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///passwords.db
```
Update `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` as per your requirements.

### 6. Run Database Migrations
```bash
$ flask db init
$ flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
$ flask db upgrade
```

### 7. Run the Application
```bash
$ python run.py
```

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Bcrypt, Flask-Migrate, Flask-CORS
- **Encryption**: Cryptography for secure password encryption and decryption
- **Database**: SQLite (can be replaced with PostgreSQL or MySQL for production)
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn (for production-ready WSGI server)

## Security Best Practices

1. **Encryption**:
   - Passwords are encrypted before storage using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
   - Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Use Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (future enhancement).

3. **Access Control**:
   - Ensure users can only view and edit their own data.

4. **Audit Logging**:
   - Log all access and modifications to sensitive data for accountability.

5. **Secure Deployment**:
   - Use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.
   - Protect the application with a firewall and follow least privilege principles.

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Development**
   - Implement user authentication routes (register, login, logout).
   - Develop CRUD operations for password management.
   - Encrypt passwords before saving to the database.

2. **Database Management**
   - Configure the database to store user information and encrypted passwords.
   - Set up efficient indexing for quick retrieval.

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Build user-friendly interfaces using HTML/CSS and integrate with backend APIs.
   - Ensure responsive design for mobile compatibility.

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all key functionalities.
   - Perform penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the application on a production server using Gunicorn and Nginx.
   - Monitor performance and implement auto-scaling if necessary.
